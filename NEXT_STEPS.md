# NEXT STEPS

## Project Trajectory Update (as of today)

### Microservice Split Reverted
We have reverted the project back to a single-backend structure. The previous attempt to split into three microservices (core, location, auth) has been undone. All sub-project directories and related files have been removed.

### What Has Been Completed
- Reverted all changes related to microservice splitting
- Removed sub-project directories and files
- Restored the backend to a clean, monolithic state
- Cleaned up any unnecessary files

### Next Actions (for when you return)

#### 1. Continue Backend Development
- Focus on implementing and refining features in the main backend directory (`backend/`)
- Keep code modular and well-documented for potential future splitting if needed

#### 2. Test Functionality
- Run and test all backend endpoints to ensure everything works as expected
- Fix any issues that may have arisen during the revert

#### 3. Update Documentation
- Ensure all documentation reflects the current monolithic backend structure
- Remove or update any references to microservices or sub-projects

**When you return:**
- Continue backend feature development in the main backend directory
- Use this file and PROJECT_TASKS.md as your guide

*End of day status: Project reverted to monolithic backend. Ready for focused backend development next session.*
