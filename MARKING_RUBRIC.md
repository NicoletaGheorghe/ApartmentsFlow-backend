- The project is working and publicly visible on GitHub pages.
- App is not publicly available for assessment or use in portfolio.

## Presentation
- The project was presented with a clear structure and in an engaging manner. Most elements were understandable for a non-technical audience. The App features were demonstrated and explained. The process of creating the project was reflected on and described.
- The project was presented clearly with some structure and some features were demonstrated.
- Project was not clearly presented.

## UI/UX
- The project has a clearly thought out UI. Accessibility has been considered. The UI is easy to use and UX is effective as a result. Visual aesthetics have been considered.

- Basic information about progress was presented at the daily standup. Some information about issues was communicated when asking for help.
- Little or no information about progress or issues communicated at the daily standup or when asking for help.

## Code
- Code is well structured and efficient. Appropriate levels of abstraction have been applied and code comments are added where appropriate. Code has been reviewed and refactored. Code used only for development or debugging has been removed. Indentation and white space is used to make code more readable. Consideration is given to code style conventions.
- Code has some structure. Abstraction may be too extreme or not sufficient. Some code only used for development or debugging is present.
- Code has little or no structure. No code comments. Code is hard to read.

## HTML
- Valid code using semantic structural elements. Standard document structure is used.
- Site is functional; elements may not be semantic. Some invalid elements may be present (e.g., text not in a valid parent).
- Site does not function or HTML structure is so poor as to be ineffective.

## CSS

- Use of React components to create an App.
- No use of Components or use is inappropriate.

## Props
- Props are used in a way that demonstrates clear understanding of why they are used. Props are used to pass functions and data.
- Some use of props to pass data.
- Props not used in the App.

## State

- Some use of state is made in the App.
- State is not used in the App.

## CRUD
- All the CRUD operations are available to users.
