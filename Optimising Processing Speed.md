# Optimising Processing Speed and Codebase Quality for AI and Teams

This document summarizes the steps and best practices applied to this project to maximize AI assistant processing speed, codebase maintainability, and overall developer efficiency. Use these guidelines for future projects!

---

## 1. Maintain a Clear Project Structure
- Use conventional folders: `controllers/`, `models/`, `routes/`, `middleware/`, `utils/`, `config/`, `__tests__/`.
- Group related files together for easy navigation.
- Remove empty or unused directories (e.g., `tests/`).

## 2. Add/Update Index Files
- Add `index.js` files to major directories to export all modules in that folder.
- This enables simpler and more maintainable imports, e.g.:
  ```js
  // Instead of:
  const userController = require('./controllers/user.controller');
  // You can do:
  const { user } = require('./controllers');
  ```

## 3. Keep Documentation Up to Date
- Update `README.md` with:
  - Project structure overview
  - Usage of index files
  - Any special conventions or tags
- Add header comments to utility/config files describing their purpose.

## 4. Use Consistent Naming
- Use clear, consistent naming for files, variables, and functions (e.g., `*.controller.js`, `*.model.js`).
- Follow a naming convention throughout the project.

## 5. Minimize Dead Code
- Regularly remove unused files, empty directories, and commented-out code.
- This reduces noise and speeds up search and analysis.

## 6. Add Tags or Comments for Key Sections
- Use `// IMPORTANT:` to highlight critical logic or security checks.
- Use `// TODO:` to mark areas for future improvement or known limitations.
- This helps both AI and human readers quickly find and understand key parts of the codebase.

## 7. Optimize Linting and Pre-commit Hooks
- Use `lint-staged` to only lint and format staged files.
- Add problematic files (e.g., MongoDB shell scripts) to `.eslintignore` and/or explicitly ignore them in `lint-staged` config.
- Ensure `.eslintignore` is present in each package or directory where linting is run.

## 8. Quality Gates with Husky
- Use Husky to run linting and tests before commits and pushes.
- Add a `test:all` script to run all backend tests and frontend linting (or tests) in one command.
- Keep Husky hooks only at the root unless you have a true monorepo.

## 9. Add Key Comments and Documentation
- Add header comments to controllers/utilities describing their purpose.
- Mark critical logic and future work with `// IMPORTANT:` and `// TODO:` comments.

## 10. (Optional) Generate a Codebase Summary
- Create a `CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md` listing all modules and their purposes for quick onboarding and reference.

## 11. Prefer Flat Directory Structures for Large Projects
- Avoid deep nesting; keep related files at the same level for faster search and navigation.

## 12. Use Semantic and Descriptive Names
- Name files and functions clearly to reflect their purpose.
- Avoid abbreviations or generic names like `utils2.js` or `temp.js`.

## 13. Keep Dependencies Lean and Updated
- Regularly prune and update dependencies for speed and security.
- Use tools like `npm-check` or `depcheck` to find and remove unused packages.

## 14. Leverage Caching for Linting and Testing
- Use `eslint --cache` and Jest's cache for faster repeated runs.
- Prefer tools and scripts that support incremental builds/tests.

## 15. Document Known Bottlenecks
- Mark slow files or tests with `// SLOW:` or in a `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
- This helps future maintainers and AI avoid or optimize them.

## 16. Use Monorepo Tools for Large Projects
- Consider Nx, Turborepo, or Lerna for multi-package repos to optimize builds, tests, and dependency graphs.

## 17. Automate Routine Maintenance
- Use scripts or CI to:
  - Run dependency updates (`npm update`).
  - Clean up old branches.
  - Run codebase health checks.

## 18. Use EditorConfig
- Add an `.editorconfig` file for consistent formatting across editors and IDEs.

## 19. Use Fast, Modern Tooling
- Prefer modern, actively maintained tools (e.g., latest Node.js, ESLint, Prettier, Jest).
- Upgrade tools regularly to benefit from performance and security improvements.

## 20. Use Environment-Specific Configurations
- Separate dev, test, and prod configs to avoid unnecessary overhead in each environment.
- Use `.env` files and config modules for clarity and speed.

## 21. Profile and Benchmark Regularly
- Use profiling tools (Node.js built-in, Chrome DevTools, etc.) to find and fix slow spots.
- Benchmark test and build times after major changes.

## 22. Encourage Team Knowledge Sharing
- Document best practices and lessons learned in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `docs/` folder.
- Share tips for fast workflows and common pitfalls.
