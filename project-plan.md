## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT for authentication
- Multer for file uploads

### Frontend
- React
- Material-UI
- Redux for state management
- Axios for API calls

### Development Tools
- Git for version control
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for code quality
- Docker for containerization

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write comprehensive comments
- Maintain consistent formatting

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all components
- Implement integration tests
- Perform end-to-end testing
- Maintain test coverage

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Project Setup → Authentication & User Management
2. Authentication & User Management → Listing Management
3. Listing Management → Advanced Features
4. Advanced Features → Testing & Deployment

### Parallel Work Streams
- Frontend and backend authentication tasks are aligned
- Listing management UI and API endpoints are synchronized
- Favorites functionality is coordinated between frontend and backend
- Testing is conducted in parallel with final feature implementation

## Progress Tracking
